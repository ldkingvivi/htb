this is heartbleed ?

/index (Status: 200)
/dev (Status: 301)
/encode (Status: 200)
/decode (Status: 200)
/omg (Status: 200)
/server-status (Status: 403)


/dev give us some info about the a note and a hyper-key ?

To do:

1) Coffee.
2) Research.
3) Fix decoder/encoder before going live.
4) Make sure encoding/decoding is only done client-side.
5) Don't use the decoder/encoder until any of this is done.
6) Find a better way to take notes.


and a lot of hex bytes , once convert to a string, we find a rsa key

it's encrypted though

Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED

so we need to figure out some password seems like

use john, doesn't generate anything from rock you, looks like we need to get this password from the server

/omg has a heartbleed img, that's a hint ?

|   VULNERABLE:
|   The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allows for stealing information intended to be protected by SSL/TLS encryption.
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases (including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1) of OpenSSL are affected by the Heartbleed bug. The bug allows for reading memory of systems protected by the vulnerable OpenSSL versions and could allow for disclosure of otherwise encrypted confidential information as well as the encryption keys themselves.

that works , let's try ssh

work with user hype, which inline with that key name

own user from the /home/hype/Desktop

looks like root is running tmux

root       1032  0.0  0.1  26416  1676 ?        Ss   10:38   0:00 /usr/bin/tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess

the conf file shows something similar

hype@Valentine:~$ cat .tmux.conf 
run-shell ~/.clone/path/resurrect.tmux


let's run that command, then get root
